SHY - Sheep Hate You

Collision group optimization:
=============================
Don't forget to maintain this grid when adding new physic elements.
The principle of this grid is to enumerate collision group to determine who is colliding who.
'Friend' collision means two entities from the same group id must collide together. In other terms,
the resulting COLLISION_MASK must not forget to include its own group id.
